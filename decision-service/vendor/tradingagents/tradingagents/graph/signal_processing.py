"""Extract the 5-tier portfolio rating from the Portfolio Manager's decision.

The Portfolio Manager produces a typed ``PortfolioDecision`` via structured
output and renders it to markdown that always carries a ``**Rating**: X``
header (see :func:`tradingagents.agents.schemas.render_pm_decision`).  The
deterministic heuristic in :mod:`tradingagents.agents.utils.rating` is more
than sufficient to extract that rating; no extra LLM call is needed.

This module exists for backwards compatibility with callers that expect a
``SignalProcessor.process_signal(text)`` interface.
