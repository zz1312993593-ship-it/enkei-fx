"""Shared 5-tier rating vocabulary and a deterministic heuristic parser.

The same five-tier scale (Buy, Overweight, Hold, Underweight, Sell) is used by:
- The Research Manager (investment plan recommendation)
- The Portfolio Manager (final position decision)
- The signal processor (rating extracted for downstream consumers)
- The memory log (rating tag stored alongside each decision entry)

Centralising it here avoids drift between those call sites.

``extract_rating`` returns ``None`` when no rating can be found, so the graph can
surface an explicit ``REVIEW`` signal instead of a fabricated ``Hold`` (#1170).
``parse_rating`` keeps the legacy silent-default behaviour for callers (e.g. the
memory log) that need a rating string regardless.
